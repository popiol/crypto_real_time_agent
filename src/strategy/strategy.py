"""Strategy engine — signal detection.

find_signals() is the only public entry point. It iterates ACTIVE_RULES and
calls signal(data) on each rule module.

To add a rule: create src/strategy/rules/<rule_name>/v1.py with a signal()
function, then add an import and entry to ACTIVE_RULES below.
To add a version: create v2.py alongside v1.py and add it to ACTIVE_RULES
while it is being evaluated against the prior version.
